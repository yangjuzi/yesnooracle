              Tarot cards originated in 15th century Italy as playing cards, but evolved into a powerful divination tool. The 78-card deck consists of 22 Major Arcana cards representing life's major themes and 56 Minor Arcana cards reflecting daily experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Each card carries symbolic meanings that have been refined over centuries, offering guidance through archetypal imagery that speaks to our subconscious mind.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-cinzel mb-4">How to Read Tarot</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Tarot reading is an intuitive art that combines symbolism, psychology, and spiritual insight. The cards don't predict the future but reveal patterns, possibilities, and guidance for your journey.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Trust your intuition when interpreting the cards. The meanings that resonate most strongly with you are often the most relevant to your situation.
